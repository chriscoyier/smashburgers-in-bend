From [Janay Wright's review](https://www.bendbulletin.com/lifestyle/entertainment/blue-eyes-burgers-and-fries-in-bend-offers-classic-diner-experience/article_5b32a9f0-06e7-11ed-9f65-9f324b0fdbf7.html):

> The smash burgers are prepared on a Jackson’s Corner griddled sweet bun with thinly shaved onions smashed directly into the patty itself. True to the smash burger style, the hamburger is thin, asymmetrical and crispy.

As a full-blown shop, they can and do offer more, a kid's burger, onion rings, soft-serve based deserts, and even a full bar.

I've been twice now and I hate to say it but I don't think the burgers are very good. I can't quite put my finger on it but the flavor just isn't there. The onion rings are good, but that's not enough to keep me coming. I worry that the Jackson's Corner empire generally has faded.
